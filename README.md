# Binary-Search-Trees-and-Text
In this project, I  wrote a program that reads in words from a file and stores them in a binary search tree, along with how many times that word occurs in the file. Then, it will print out the data about all the words in the file, in alphabetical order.
The program has the following functions:
•	Welcome the user to the program.
•	Prompt the user to enter a file name.
•	Open the file. If the file does not exist, you should print an error message and end the program.
•	Read words from the file, one by one. Count the number of times each word occurs. For our purposes, a “word” is a contiguous set of non-white-space characters. In other words, the words “said”, “Said”, and “said.” are all distinct and separate.
•	Once all the words are read, print out the following information:
o	The total number of words in the file.
o	The total number of distinct words in the file (how many different words are in the file) 
o	A list of all the words in the file, along with the number of times that word appeared in the file, in alphabetical order by word. Note, by default, the order is case-sensitive.
